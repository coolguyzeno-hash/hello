                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my game portfolio! I'm Zeno, a passionate and dedicated game developer who has devoted countless hours to
                    mastering the art of interactive entertainment and web-based gaming experiences. My journey into game development began
                    with a simple fascination: the power of games to captivate, educate, and inspire players across all walks of life.
                    What started as a hobby has evolved into a full-fledged passion, driving me to create innovative, engaging, and
                    memorable gaming experiences that push the boundaries of what browser-based games can achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my development career, I've explored a diverse range of game genres and mechanics, from addictive incremental
                    clicker games that test players' strategic thinking and patience, to narrative-driven gambling simulators that blend
                    risk-taking with storytelling, and even educational RPG-style simulators that transform learning into an adventure.
                    Each project represents not just a game, but a carefully crafted experience designed to engage players on multiple
                    levels—intellectually, emotionally, and entertainingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My design philosophy centers around accessibility and player engagement. I believe that great games shouldn't require
                    expensive hardware or complex installations. That's why all my projects are browser-based and instantly playable,
                    ensuring that anyone with an internet connection can dive into these experiences immediately. This commitment to
                    accessibility drives every design decision I make, from intuitive user interfaces to responsive controls that work
                    seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the technical aspects, I'm deeply invested in the creative storytelling and thematic elements that make games
                    truly memorable. Whether it's the progression satisfaction of watching numbers grow in an idle game, the heart-pounding
                    tension of a final casino bet, or the educational journey through pregnancy development, I strive to create experiences
                    that resonate with players long after they've closed the browser tab. Each game tells a story, teaches a lesson, or
                    provides a unique perspective that enriches the player's understanding of game design and interactive media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you explore my portfolio below, you'll discover three distinct gaming experiences, each showcasing different aspects
                    of my development skills and creative vision. From systems design and balance in incremental mechanics, to narrative
                    pacing and dramatic tension in gambling simulations, to educational content delivery through gamification—these projects
                    represent my growth as a developer and my commitment to creating meaningful interactive experiences. I invite you to
                    play through each game, experience the mechanics firsthand, and join me on this ongoing journey of game development
                    excellence. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy playing these games as much as I enjoyed creating them!
